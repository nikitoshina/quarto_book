# StatiCrypt

StatiCrypt uses AES-256 and WebCrypto to encrypt your HTML file with your long password, and returns a static HTML page showing a password prompt that you can now safely upload anywhere, the page containing your encrypted content and decryption happening in javascript client side (see [a live example](https://robinmoisson.github.io/staticrypt/example/encrypted/example.html)).

This means you can **password protect the content of your _public_ static HTML file, without any back-end** - serving it over Netlify, GitHub pages, etc. (see the detail of [how it works](#how-staticrypt-works)).

You can encrypt a file online in your browser (client side) at [robinmoisson.github.io/staticrypt](https://robinmoisson.github.io/staticrypt), or use the CLI to do it in your terminal or build process.

## CLI

**Migration:** v3 brings many improvements, a clearer CLI and simpler `password_template` over v2. See the [migration guide from v2 to v3](MIGRATING.md). v3 uses WebCrypto which is only available in HTTPS or localhost contexts, so if you need to use it in HTTP you'll need to use v2.

### Installation

Staticrypt is available through npm as a CLI, install with

```bash
npm install staticrypt
```

You can then run it with `npx staticrypt ...`. You can also install globally with `npm install -g staticrypt` and then just call `staticrypt ...` from anywhere.

### Examples

> These examples will create a `.staticrypt.json` file in the current directory, see [the FAQ](#why-does-staticrypt-create-a-config-file) as to why. You can prevent it by setting the `--config` flag to "false".

**Encrypt a file:** encrypt `test.html` and create a `encrypted/test.html` file (use `-d my_directory` to change the output directory):

```bash
# this will prompt you for the password, which won't stay in your terminal command history
staticrypt test.html

# you can also pass the password as an argument
staticrypt test.html -p <long-password>
```

**Encrypt a file with the password in an environment variable:** set your long password in the `STATICRYPT_PASSWORD` environment variable ([`.env` files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv#usage) are supported):

```bash
# the password is in the STATICRYPT_PASSWORD env variable, you won't be prompted
staticrypt test.html
```

**Encrypt multiple files at once** and put them in an `encrypted/` directory:

```bash
# this will encrypt test_A.html and test_B.html
staticrypt test_A.html test_B.html
# => encrypted files are in encrypted/test_A.html and encrypted/test_B.html

# you can also use the -r flag to recursively encrypt all files in a directory
staticrypt dir_to_encrypt -r
# => encrypted files are in encrypted/dir_to_encrypt/...

# if you don't want to include the directory name in the output path, you can use dir_to_encrypt/* 
# instead. `-r` will include potential subdirectories as well
staticrypt dir_to_encrypt/* -r
# => encrypted files are in encrypted/...
```

**Replace all the files in a folder with encrypted ones**:

```bash
# 'dir_to_encrypt/*' as argument will select all the files in the directory ('-r' recursively), and the 
# '-d dir_to_encrypt' will put them in the same directory, overwriting the files
staticrypt dir_to_encrypt/* -r -d dir_to_encrypt
```

**Get a shareable link containing the hashed password, that will autodecrypt the file** - you can include your file URL or leave blank. (⚠️ you should keep your `.staticrypt.json` so the salt is the same each time you encrypt, or re-encrypting will [invalidate the link](#why-does-staticrypt-create-a-config-file)): 

```bash
# you can also pass '--share' without specifying the URL to get the `#staticrypt_pwd=...` 
staticrypt test.html --share https://example.com/encrypted.html
# => https://example.com/encrypted.html#staticrypt_pwd=5bfbf1343c7257cd7be23ecd74bb37fa2c76d041042654f358b6255baeab898f
```

**Pin the salt to use staticrypt in your CI in a build step** - if you want want the "Remember-me" or share features to work accross multiple pages or multiple successive deployment, the salt needs to stay the same ([see why](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt#why-does-staticrypt-create-a-config-file)). If you run StatiCrypt in a CI step, you can pin the salt in two ways:

- either commit the `.staticrypt.json` config file - you can generate a random salt and config file on your local machine with:

    ```bash
    staticrypt --salt
    ```
  
- or hardcode the salt in the encryption command in the CI script:

    ```bash
    staticrypt test.html --salt 12345678901234567890123456789012
    ```

> See an exemple of how to use StatiCrypt in a CI build step in this community project: [a-nau/password-protected-website-template](https://github.com/a-nau/password-protected-website-template)

**Customize the password prompt** to have the encrypted page match your style (see [the FAQ](#can-i-customize-the-password-prompt) for a full custom template):

```bash
# use your own custom template
staticrypt test.html -t my/own/password_template.html

# or customize the default template
staticrypt test.html --template-color-primary "#fd45a4" --template-title "My custom title" --template-instructions "To unlock this file, you should..." ...
```

**Decrypt files you encrypted earlier** with StatiCrypt straight from the CLI by including the `--decrypt` flag. (So if you want, you can keep only the encrypted files.) The `-r|--recursive` flag and output `-d|--directory` option work the same way as when encrypting (default name for the output directory is `decrypted`):

```bash
staticrypt encrypted/test.html --decrypt
# => decrypted file is in decrypted/test.html
```

### CLI Reference

The password argument is optional if `STATICRYPT_PASSWORD` is set in the environment or `.env` file.

## HOW STATICRYPT WORKS

So, how can you password protect html without a back-end?

StatiCrypt uses WebCrypto to generate a static, password protected page that can be decrypted in-browser. You can then just send or upload the generated page to a place serving static content (github pages, for example) and you're done: the page will prompt users for a password, and the javascript will decrypt and load your HTML, all done in the browser.

So it basically encrypts your page and puts everything in a user-friendly way to enter the password in the new file.

## FAQ

### Is it secure?

Simple answer: your file content has been encrypted with AES-256, a popular and strong encryption algorithm. You can now upload it to any public place and no one will be able to read it without the password. So if you used a long, strong password, then yes it should be secure.

Longer answer: actual security depends on a number of factors and on the threat model you want to protect against. Because your full encrypted file is accessible client side, brute-force/dictionary attacks would be easy to do at a fast pace: **use a long, unusual password**. We recommend 16+ alphanum characters, [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is a great open-source password manager if you don't have one already.

On the technical aspects: we use AES in CBC mode (see a discussion on why this mode is appropriate for StatiCrypt in [#19](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt/issues/19)) and key stretching with 600k PBKDF2-SHA256 iterations to slow down brute-force attacks (which is the [recommended number](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pbkdf2) by OWASP - read a detailed report on why this number and the security model of StatiCrypt in [#159](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt/issues/159)).

**Transparency disclaimer:** I am not a cryptographer. I try my best to get the implementation right, listen to feedback and be transparent in stewarding StatiCrypt. But please adjust accordingly depending on your threat model: if you are an at-risk activist or have very sensitive crypto assets to protect, you might want to use something else.

### Can I customize the password prompt?

Yes! Just copy `lib/password_template.html`, modify it to suit your style and point to your template file with the `-t path/to/my/file.html` flag. 

Be careful to not break the encrypting javascript part, the variables replaced by StatiCrypt are in this format: `/*[|variable|]*/0`. Don't leave out the `0` at the end, this weird syntax is to avoid conflict with other templating engines while still being read as valid JS to parsers so we can use auto-formatting on the template files.

### Can I support multiple users with different passwords?

At the moment you can only use one passsword per page (though there is a reflection on supporting decryption with multiple different passwords in [#158](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt/issues/158)). If you want to support multiple users so you can invalidate passwords individualy, the current recommended way is the following:

- Make a script that will encrypt your files with different passwords and different output folders

  ```
  staticrypt test.html -p <john-password> -d john
  ...
  ```
  
- send each user the link to their folder with their password: `https://example.com/john/test.html`

In a way, the username input becomes the folder in the `https://example.com/<username>` URL, and the password input is the HTML form. You can then invalidate a single password by changing it in your script and running it again. 

### Why doesn't StatiCrypt work in HTTP?

From version 3.x StatiCrypt only uses the browser WebCrypto API, which makes it more secure but is only available in HTTPS or on localhost. If you need to use it in HTTP, you can use version 2.x which offers the CryptoJS engine as an option, and will work everywhere.

### Why does StatiCrypt create a config file?

The "Remember me" feature stores the user password hashed and salted in the browser's localStorage, so it needs the salt to be the same each time you encrypt otherwise the user would be logged out when you encrypt the page again. The config file is a way to store the salt in between runs, so you don't have to remember it and pass it manually.

When deciding what salt to use, StatiCrypt will first look for a `--salt` flag, then try to get the salt from the config file, and if it still doesn't find a salt it will generate a random one. It then saves the salt in the config file.

If you don't want StatiCrypt to create or use the config file, you can set `--config false` to disable it.

The salt isn't secret (it's publicly visible on the encrypted file), so you don't need to worry about hiding the config file. If you're encrypting as part of a CI step, you can commit the `.staticrypt.json` file so it's accessible to your build server.

### How does the "Remember me" checkbox work?

The CLI will add a "Remember me" checkbox on the password prompt by default (`--remember false` to disable). If the user checks it, the (salted + hashed) password will be stored in their browser's localStorage and the page will attempt to auto-decrypt when they come back.

If no value is provided the stored password doesn't expire, you can also give it a value in days for how long should the store value be kept with `--remember NUMBER_OF_DAYS`. If the user reconnects to the page after the expiration date the stored value will be cleared.

#### "Logging out"

You can clear StatiCrypt values in localStorage (effectively "logging out") at any time by appending `staticrypt_logout` to the URL fragment (`https://mysite.com#staticrypt_logout`).

#### Encrypting multiple pages

This allows encrypting multiple page on a single domain with the same password: if you check "Remember me", you'll have to enter your password once then all the pages on that domain will automatically decrypt their content. Because the hashed value is stored in the browser's localStorage, this will only work if all the pages are on the same domain name.

#### Is the "Remember me" checkbox secure?

In case the value stored in the browser becomes compromised an attacker can decrypt the page, but because it's stored salted and hashed this should still protect against password reuse attacks if you've used the password on other websites (of course, please use a long, unique password nonetheless).

#### Can I remove the "Remember me" checkbox?

If you don't want the checkbox to be included, you can set the `--remember false` flag to disable it.

### Opening PRs and issues

I administer the project when I have time and motivation. You're free to open PRs if you're ok with having no response for a (possibly very) long time and me possibly ending up getting inspiration from your proposal but merging something different myself (I'll try to credit you though). Apologies in advance for the delay, and thank you for making the project better!

Opening issues with suggestions and bug reports is welcome.

If you find a serious security bug please open an issue or contact me following the instructions in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and I'll try to fix it relatively quickly.

### Security

You can find the security policy and secure contact details in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). If you have general ideas or feedback around the implementation or StatiCrypt security model they are very welcome, if it's not extra sensitive feel free to open an issue. A couple of place where security was discussed previously are [#19](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt/issues/19) and [#159](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt/issues/159).

### Guidelines to contributing

#### Source map

- `cli/` - The command-line interface published to NPM.
- `example/` - Example encrypted files, used as an example in the public website and for manual testing.
- `lib/` - Files shared across www and cli.
- `scripts/` - Convenient scripts for building the project.
- `index.html` - The root of the in-browser encryption site hosted at https://robinmoisson.github.io/staticrypt. Kept in the root of the repo for easy deploys to GitHub Pages.

#### Build

When editing StatiCrypt logic, we want to sync the changes to the browser version, the CLI and the example files, so all of them use the new logic. To do so, run:  

```
npm install
npm run build
```

#### Test

The testing is done manually for now - you can run [build](#build), then open `example/encrypted/example.html` and check everything works correctly. There is an open issue to automate this in [#136](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt/issues/136), feel free to contribute to setting up a test framework if you'd like!
