If you are reading this book, you are likely familiar with basic
statistics, especially the standard error. And if you are an economist,
you know how challenging it can be to handle biases and variables
accurately.

We will explore the components of Total Survey Error (TSE) and methods
to minimize them, enhancing the survey results' quality. Additionally,
we will delve into survey design, covering goal setting, sample
selection, and comprehension of the survey process.

Let's start with a question: What is a survey? It may seem simple, but
it's important to comprehend our subject matter.

A formal definition from @grovesSurveyMethodology2011 is:

> The survey is a
>
> **systematic method**
>
> for **gathering information** from
>
> (a sample of) **entities**
>
> for the purpose of
>
> **constructing quantitative descriptors**
>
> of the attributes of the larger population
>
> of which the entities are members.

A more human readable definition comes from Caroline
@jarrettSurveysThatWork2021:

> The survey is a
>
> **process**
>
> for **getting answers to questions** from
>
> (a sample of) **people**
>
> for the purpose of
>
> **getting numbers**
>
> that **you can use to make decisions.**

## Total Survey Error (TSE)

What makes a survey credible? The answer lies in its accuracy, effective
design, and minimal error. Total Survey Error (TSE)
[@grovesSurveyMethodology2011] is a framework enabling researchers to
identify and mitigate the various errors that can surface in surveys. By
understanding these errors, proactive measures can be taken to minimize
them in subsequent surveys.

TSE consists of several components:

> Total Survey Error = Specification error + Processing error + Sampling
> error + Coverage error + Non-response error + Measurement error

1.  **Specification error**: Specification errors manifest when there's
    no distinct link between theoretical concepts or constructs and the
    survey variables. It's vital to ensure that the survey questions
    aptly capture the intended concepts. Uninsightful questions yield
    uninformative results, so thorough literature reviews are critical.

2.  **Processing error**: These errors pertain to issues arising during
    the collection and management of survey data. Such errors could
    comprise data entry inaccuracies, coding mistakes, or other
    inconsistencies that may occur during data processing. Adherence to
    reproducible research practices is vital!

3.  **Sampling error**: Sampling errors occur because surveys typically
    gather data from a subset of individuals rather than the entire
    population of interest. Such errors stem from the fact that the
    sample results may not flawlessly reflect the true population
    values.

4.  **Coverage error**: Coverage errors happen when individuals from the
    target population are absent from the sampling frame used to draw a
    representative sample. This can lead to under-representation or
    over-representation of certain groups within the survey.

5.  **Non-response error**: Non-response errors occur when individuals
    selected for the survey either choose not to participate or fail to
    provide comprehensive responses. This could introduce bias if
    non-respondents differ significantly from respondents in crucial
    aspects.

6.  **Measurement error**: Measurement errors arise from discrepancies
    between the estimated value and the "true" value, often attributed
    to survey design elements. Such errors can involve inaccuracies in
    question phrasing, response options, or respondent interpretation.

## Basic Theoretical Model of the Survey Process

Understanding the errors intrinsic to surveys, let's delve into the
respondent's mental process while answering question --- where potential
pitfalls may lie. The survey process encompasses several steps that
respondents undertake when addressing survey questions:

1.  **Retrieval of information**: The respondent comprehends and forms
    an understanding of the concepts and terms presented in the
    question.

2.  **Comprehension of the question**: The respondent retrieves
    pertinent information from memory to formulate an answer.

3.  **Judgment of appropriate answer**: The respondent determines how to
    communicate the retrieved information and selects the most suitable
    answer.

4.  **Communication of answer**: The respondent provides a response to
    the question.

Consider your thought process when answering the following question and
identify any potential confusion:

> Over the *last five* working days, what percentage of time did you use
> corporate-grade communication software?

Total Survey Error can be represented scientifically, showing when each
error might occur.

We will delve into each of these stages and build an understanding of
how to avoid common errors.

Effective survey design is critical to minimizing the total survey
error. It involves several key steps:

### Establishing goals

The utility of a survey is only as great as the insights it provides.

> Name of the game is "Ask stupid questions -- get stupid answers".

Before you even start with designing your survey ask the three
questions:

1.  What do you want to understand?
2.  Why do you need this understanding?
3.  What decisions will be guided by the answers?

Ensure to define the problem, conduct an exhaustive literature review,
identify gaps in the discussion, and determine why it's important to
address these gaps. Then use theory to form hypotheses and decide on the
testing methods.

In a more business oriented setting, I prefer these three questions:

1.  What decisions will the survey guide?
2.  What information is needed for these decisions?
3.  How will the survey improve understanding?

### Target Population and Sampling Frame

For a successful survey, we must outline our target population and
sampling frame. The target population represents the group we aim to
study, while the sampling frame is the source from which we draw our
sample.

> Better to ask the right people than many people.

However, obtaining complete coverage can be challenging. Undercoverage
happens when certain individuals or groups in the target population are
inadequately represented in the sampling frame.

This can result in biased outcomes. Conversely, overcoverage refers to
the inclusion of individuals or groups in the sampling frame who are not
part of the target population, potentially leading to extraneous data
collection and biases.

![Overcoverage](images/overcoverage.png)
:::

To ensure a representative sample, it's crucial to minimize
undercoverage and overcoverage. This can be achieved by methodically
designing the sampling frame, considering aspects such as demographics,
location, marketing strategy, and time constraints. Frequent evaluation
and adjustments of the sampling frame are key to addressing any coverage
issues that might surface.

If you happen to miss your target population, you might find yourself
taking a detour in the footsteps of Mr. Worldwide to Alaska. In the 2012
incident Pitbull participated in a commercial where Walmart clients
could vote for the store where the artist would perform. Well, asking a
question on the internet is akin to asking a question to everyone, and
things took an unexpected turn. The vote was hijacked, and Pitbull ended
up being sent to Alaska. So, it's a reminder that when conducting
surveys, it's crucial to ensure you're reaching the right people and
avoiding any unintended outcomes.

### Representativeness

Achieving representativeness in surveys is crucial for obtaining a
balanced reflection of the population. This ensures that the selected
sample accurately depicts the characteristics, opinions, or behaviors of
the larger population.

Aiming for representativeness helps portray a comprehensive image
reflecting the true diversity of the study population.

Stamps)](images/representativeness_2.png)

## Iterative Design

Iterative design provides valuable insights about the target population.
This process involves repeated cycles of learning, refining, and
scaling, aimed at increasing the effectiveness of surveys. The initial
step is to create a rough draft of the survey and then interview someone
from the target audience to determine if the questions are clear and
relevant to them. Based on the feedback, the survey is edited and
further refined through discussions with a larger group of people. It's
important to avoid distributing the survey to the entire target pool
initially. If changes are necessary after the initial distribution,
there may not be enough participants left for a revised survey, not to
mention the potential waste of resources.

The process can be outlined in three progressive steps:

> 1.  Conduct an interview with 1 person from the target audience.
> 2.  Engage in discussions with a group of 10 people.
> 3.  Distribute the survey to a broader group of 100 people.

This iterative approach allows researchers to extract valuable insights
from each interaction, continuously improve their survey tools, and
eventually scale up to a wider audience for comprehensive analysis. Such
a methodology not only enhances the understanding of the subject matter
but also ensures the reliability of the data collected, informing
decision-making.

## The People You Ask and Those Who Respond

In fieldwork, we interact with participants and collect their responses.
However, it's critical to address potential challenges in reaching the
desired target group. Here are the key considerations:

1.  **Target Population**: The specific group we aim to understand or
    represent through the survey.

2.  **Sample Frame**: The list or source used to select our survey
    sample, ensuring it aligns with the target population.

3.  **People you ask**: Individuals approached to participate in the
    survey, selected based on the sample frame and target population.

4.  **People who respond**: The participants who voluntarily provide
    their responses.

By carefully defining the target population, using an appropriate sample
frame, effectively engaging participants, and analyzing respondent
characteristics, we enhance the reliability and validity of our survey
findings.

## What Responses Depend On

Survey participant responses are influenced by key factors, including
effort, reward, and trust. Recognizing these dependencies can enhance
the quality and reliability of survey data.

The diagram below, adapted from @jarrettFormsThatWork2009's work on web
form design, illustrates the interplay between these factors:

![Response Dependencies](images/triangle.png)

1.  **Effort**: The amount of effort required from participants to
    complete the survey can significantly impact their willingness to
    respond. Long, complex, or time-consuming surveys may discourage
    participation, leading to lower response rates.

2.  **Reward**: Participants often seek some form of incentive or
    benefit for their involvement in the survey. This can include
    tangible rewards, such as monetary compensation or gift cards, or
    intangible rewards, such as the satisfaction of contributing to
    research or personal interest in the survey topic. Offering
    appropriate rewards can motivate participants to provide accurate
    and thoughtful responses.

3.  **Trust**: Building trust with survey participants is important for
    encouraging open and honest responses. Participants need to feel
    confident that their privacy and confidentiality are respected,
    their data will be handled securely, and the survey is conducted by
    a reputable organization. Clear communication about data protection
    measures and ethical considerations helps establish trust and
    increases the likelihood of obtaining reliable responses.

By taking into account the effort required, providing appropriate
rewards, and building trust in the survey process, you can foster an
environment conducive to obtaining high-quality responses from
participants.

## How BAD Are U???

In an intriguing study titled @johnStrangersPlaneContextdependent2011,
experiments were conducted to understand the factors that influence
people's willingness to divulge personal information. One notable
experiment involved altering the design of a survey page and observing
its impact on disclosure rates.

Students from Carnegie Mellon University were recruited for the study,
and variations were made to the survey's title and interface. In the
frivolous condition, the survey bore a humorous title, "How BAD are
U??", and a playful appearance to downplay privacy concerns. Conversely,
the baseline condition had the survey presented within a professional
context, titled "Carnegie Mellon University Survey of Ethical
Standards."

Interestingly, participants in the frivolous condition were, on average,
1.7 times more likely to confess to engaging in sensitive behaviors
compared to those in the baseline condition. For example, individuals in
the frivolous condition were over twice as likely to admit to taking
nude photos of themselves or a partner, with a 31.8% admission rate in
the frivolous condition versus a 15.7% rate in the baseline condition.

These findings suggest that individuals might feel more at ease sharing
personal information on platforms that don't appear strictly
professional, even though these platforms could potentially pose a
higher risk of data misuse. The results highlight the complex interplay
between context, trust, and disclosure when it comes to personal
information.

This study brings to light the intricate nature of human behavior and
the various factors that influence our readiness to reveal personal
information in different settings. Understanding these dynamics is
pivotal in designing surveys and online platforms that achieve the right
balance between user trust and data protection.

## Answering a Question

According to @tourangeauPsychologySurveyResponse2000, there are four key
steps involved in effectively answering a survey question. These steps
provide valuable insights into the respondent's process and are critical
to designing effective surveys:

1.  **Understand the question**: The first step in answering a survey
    question involves comprehension. Respondents need to accurately
    understand the question in order to provide a meaningful response.
    Therefore, the clarity and readability of the question are of utmost
    importance. For example:

    > Understand: In the last five days at work, what percentage of time
    > did you use corporate-grade communication software?

2.  **Find an answer**: Once the question is understood, respondents
    must search their memory or knowledge to identify a suitable answer.
    This answer should be based on the information available to them.
    For instance:

    > Remember:
    >
    > 1.  What color of shirt did you wear Tuesday 2 weeks ago?
    > 2.  What color of shirt did you wear for New Years?
    > 3.  How did you celebrate your 18th birthday?
    > 4.  What did you have for breakfast yesterday?
    > 5.  When did the American Civil War start?

3.  **Judge the answer**: After identifying a potential answer,
    respondents evaluate whether they feel comfortable sharing it.
    Factors such as privacy, social desirability, and the sensitivity of
    the information play a role in this judgment process. For example:

    > Agree or Disagree with the following statement: "I approve of the
    > current management's actions."
    >
    > 1.  Strongly agree
    > 2.  Agree
    > 3.  Neither
    > 4.  Disagree
    > 5.  Strongly disagree

Though the question seems straightforward, expressing disagreement with
the current management's actions could have potential consequences, such
as risk of dismissal if the management becomes aware of your lack of
support.

4.  **Place the answer**: Finally, respondents need to appropriately map
    their answer onto the response options provided. This could involve
    selecting a specific category, rating on a scale, or providing a
    written response. For example:

    > What is your major?
    >
    > What is your career?
    >
    > What is your major? \_\_\_\_
    >
    > What is your career? \_\_\_\_

### Enhancing Question Quality

The process of refining survey questions can drastically improve the
quality of responses received. For instance, the original question: "In
the last five days at work what percentage of time did you use corporate
grade communication software?" can be revised into multiple more
specific questions, enhancing clarity and ensuring accurate responses.
An example of these revised questions are:

> How would you improve the question?

"On your most recent working day, what percentage of time did you use
messaging software other than email (Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram,
etc.)?"

"What do you use for communication at work? (Select all that apply)"

-   Email
-   Slack
-   Discord
-   WhatsApp
-   Other

Insights from survey response psychology can aid researchers in
designing high-quality questionnaires that minimize respondent burden,
enhance data quality, and create a better overall survey experience.

In this chapter, we focused on reducing Total Survey Error and enhancing
survey design, exploring various sources of survey errors and the
importance of careful selection of target populations. Additionally, we
examined factors influencing survey responses and the process of
answering questions. In the next chapter, we will delve more deeply into
question design.
