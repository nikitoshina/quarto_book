If you want your document to look a certain way for a journal, thesis, or a report you will appreciate the extensive customization of Pandoc template both in LaTeX and HTML. These templates are often a combination of LaTeX and Pandoc specific syntax. There is a large variety customizable [templates](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/listing-journals.html) available.

Here we will see how to use an [unofficial template for USFCA Economics Master's theses](https://github.com/nikitoshina/USFCA-Thesis-Template).

## Getting Started

To use this template, you will need to install Quarto and TinyTeX.

### RStudio

Install Quarto and TinyTeX by running the following command in R:

```

install.packages(c("quarto", "tinytex"))

```

### Visual Studio Code

Install the Quarto extension by going to Extensions -> search for "Quarto" -> install. Then run the following command in the terminal if you don't have TinyTeX installed:

```

quarto install tinytex

```

## Adding the Quarto Template

To add the template to your project, run the following command in your terminal:

```

quarto add template nikitoshina/USFCA-Thesis-Template

```

This will download all the necessary folders with the LaTeX files for your thesis. You can render your project from within your folder by running the following command in terminal:

```

quarto render

```

## Usage

Your first chapter should be written in index.qmd, and you can add additional chapters to the /Chapters folder. You can add information about the document such as abstract in the `_quarto.yml`.
