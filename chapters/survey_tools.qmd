title: Survey Tools 
---

Researchers have a wide array of survey tools to choose from, each offering
unique features and advantages. Understanding these options is useful for data collection.
In this chapter we will look at different ways for physical and digital surveying
as well as platforms for participant recruitment.

### Physical Survey Methods

Traditional physical survey methods provide diverse ways to collect data,
especially beneficial in situations where digital access may be limited. 

1. **Paper Surveys**: These are versatile and can be distributed in various
   settings, additionally they don't require familiarity with laptops or phones.
2. **In-person Interviews**: This method allows for direct participant
   interaction, clarification of complex questions, and collection of nuanced
responses.
3. **Telephone Surveys**: These surveys are efficient for collecting data from
   geographically dispersed samples, but potential biases should be considered,
such as excluding individuals without telephones.
4. **Mail Surveys**: This approach reaches a wide range of individuals,
   especially those without internet access. Response rates and turnaround
times may vary.
5. **Intercept Surveys**: Involves approaching individuals in public spaces for
   participation, allowing for immediate data collection, yet potential issues
with representativeness and privacy may arise.

For all physical methods, it is imperative to adhere to ethical guidelines for
data collection and ensure participant privacy. Additionally, the training and
supervision of assistants who will conduct physical surveys are essential.

### Digital Survey Tools

A variety of digital survey platforms cater to different research needs,
providing an array of features, usability levels, and costs.

1. **[Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)**: Offers
   user-friendly and free services, suitable for simple surveys or
budget-constrained projects.
2. **[Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/)**: Provides an interactive interface
   for engaging surveys, enhancing user experience and response rates.
   It create the best looking surveys by far.
3. **[Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/)**: A comprehensive platform
   favoring complex survey design with advanced features like conditional
logic, built-in distribution capabilities, collaboration features, and
extensive customization. Many universities have institutional subscriptions to
Qualtrics, so make sure to check whether you have access!
4. **[SMARTRIQS](https://smartriqs.com/)**: An open-source tool that integrates
   with Qualtrics for conducting interactive step-based online experiments.
5. **[LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/)**: A customizable, open-source
   survey tool ideal for complex survey flows, especially when Qualtrics is not
available.
6. **[O-tree](https://www.otree.org/)**: Designed specifically for economic
   experiments and social science research with features like decision-making
games, real-time data collection, and payment processing.
7. **[Z-Tree](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/ztree/en.html)**: Z-Tree (Zurich
   Toolbox for Readymade Economic Experiments) is a software for developing and
conducting economic experiments. It provides a control language designed to be
easy to learn and use, enabling users to quickly create complex experiments.
8. **[ChoiceFlow](https://www.choice-flow.com/)**: ChoiceFlow is a framework
   for designing and running complex behavioral experiments online. It supports
a wide range of experimental designs and integrates seamlessly with major
online labor marketplaces, enabling researchers to efficiently recruit and pay
participants.


### Participant Recruitment Platforms

Platforms like [Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk)](https://www.mturk.com/),
[Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/), and
[Respondent](https://www.respondent.io/) offer an additional dimension to
survey tools, serving as spaces for recruiting and compensating participants.

1. **[Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk)](https://www.mturk.com/)**: A
   crowdsourcing platform providing a large, diverse participant pool at a
relatively low cost, albeit with considerations for fair compensation and data
quality.
2. **[Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/)**: Similar to MTurk, but specifically
   designed for academic research with pre-screened participants and emphasis
on ethical standards.
3. **[Respondent](https://www.respondent.io/)**: Specializes in finding
   professionals for high-quality research, particularly useful for B2B market
research or studies requiring professional expertise.

## Summary

In conclusion, the selection of survey tools and recruitment platforms should
align with the specific needs, goals, and ethical considerations of the
research. Whether the priority is simplicity, advanced features, interactive
experiments, or a focus on a specific subject area, choosing the appropriate
tool can greatly enhance the effectiveness and insightfulness of the research.
In the next chapter, we will explore APIs and how to utilize them for
extracting data from the internet.
