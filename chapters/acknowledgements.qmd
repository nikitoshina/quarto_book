I dedicate this book to my late grandfather, Vladimir Zamashikov.

I extend my deepest gratitude to Thomas Weinandy, who convinced me to transform my rough draft into a published book and guided me through the process. Without him, this would not have been possible.

I am deeply indebted to Parsa Rahimi for his unwavering support and meticulous review of all my chapters, edits, and ideas.

Additionally, I am grateful to the faculty, librarians, writing center staff, and the Center for Business Studies and Innovation (CBSI) at the University of San Francisco for their guidance.

Gordon Getty deserves thanks for inspiring me to write more confidently about my skills.

The team at APress, especially Shaul Elson, Commissioning Editor, Laura Berendson, Development Editor, and Gryffin Winkler, Editorial Assistant, guided me through the publishing process.

Special thanks to everyone at APress whose efforts made this book a reality.

I gratefully acknowledge John Chetwynd, Jake Consgrove, Timofei Lopukhov, and Alexander Rom, whose support, curiosity, and confidence in my work are deeply appreciated.
