## R and RStudio Set Up

To begin our data analysis journey, we will utilize the R language, which was specifically designed by statisticians for statisticians. R boasts an intuitive syntax and workflow, enabling us to create readable and **reproducible** code, making it ideal for data analysis tasks.

Before we dive into the exciting world of data exploration and modeling, it's essential to understand the distinction between R and RStudio IDE. R is the actual programming language itself, while RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a user-friendly interface to work with R efficiently. In other words, RStudio serves as a helpful tool to interact with R and enhances the overall coding experience.

To get started, you'll need to download both R and RStudio. R acts as the backbone, and RStudio complements it, making the coding process smoother and more accessible, especially for beginners. So, make sure to install both R and RStudio on your computer to embark on your data analysis journey seamlessly. Let's dive in and explore the incredible possibilities that R and RStudio have to offer!
## Download R

R is maintained through [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### For macOS

1.  Go to <https://cran.r-project.org/>
2.  Select "Download R for macOS"
3.  If you have Apple Silicon mac (M1,M2...) download the latest version that has -arm64 in its name (R-4.2.2-arm64.pkg)
4.  If you have Intel Max Download one without -arm64 (R-4.2.2.pkg)
5.  Follow the steps from the installation wizzard
6.  The installer lets you customize your installation, but the defaults will be suitable for most users
7.  Your computer might ask for your password before installing new programs

### For Windows

1.  Go to <https://cran.r-project.org/>
2.  Select "Download R for Windows"
3.  Click on "base"
4.  Click the first link at the top of the new page (Download R-4.2.2 for Windows)
5.  ink downloads an installer program, which installs the most up-to-date version of R for Windows.
6.  Follow the steps from the installation wizzard
7.  The installer lets you customize your installation, but the defaults will be suitable for most users
8.  You might need administration privileges to install new software on your machine

## Download RStudio

Rstudio is like a Microsoft Word for writing text, but instead of text RStudio helps you write in R. RStudio is also free and easy to install! Go to [RStudio Website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), click on DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO or select your operation system below, and follow the isntallation instructions.

## Configure RStudio

First watch an introduction to RStudio: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIrsOBy5k58> and introduction to projects: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdTtTN8PUqU>

Now the most crucial part!!! Change the default theme of RStudio from light to dark! To do this

1.  Go to the top panel
2.  Select the Tools tab
3.  Navigate to Global Options
4.  Select Appearance
5.  In Editor Theme, select "Dracula"
6.  Click Apply

Now let's install a cooler font with ligatures! Install fira-code: <https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing>. **Restart** RStudio for the font to load. Then go back to Appearance, choose FiraCode, and hit apply.

## Install Packages

An R package is a collection of useful functions, documentation, and data sets that can be used in your own R code after it is loaded. These packages typically focus on a specific task and make use of pre-written routines for various data science tasks.

You can install packages with a single line of code:

```         
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

You can also install multiple packages at the same time using c():

```         
install.packages(c("tidyverse","gapminder"))
```

You can load packages using the library() function:

```         
library("tidyverse")
```

Run the following command to install packages we will use in class

```         
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "janitor", "esquisse", "modelsummary", "styler"))
```
