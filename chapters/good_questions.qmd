title: Design Questions
---

After exploring the broad topic of Survey Errors, we now shift our focus to the heart of any survey 
- the questions themselves. We'll tackle common concerns such as
the quality of questions, the critical role of their order, the implications of including 'N/A' responses,
and the impact of survey length. 

## Guidelines for Effective Question Design

Question design is fundamentally a human-centric exercise. 
It's about crafting questions that are easily understandable,
allowing respondents to effortlessly process, judge, and articulate their answers.
Drawing from the insights of @krosnickQuestionnaireDesign2018,
here is a set of guidelines for developing survey questions:

1.  Use simple and familiar words to ensure clarity and comprehension.
    Avoid technical terms, jargon, and slang.
2.  Employ simple sentence structures and syntax for easy understanding.
3.  Avoid words with ambiguous meanings to ensure all respondents
    interpret the questions similarly.
4.  Make questions specific and concrete rather than general and
    abstract to obtain consistent and reliable responses.
5.  Provide response options that are exhaustive (covering all possible
    choices) and mutually exclusive (no overlap between options).
6.  Avoid leading or loaded questions that sway respondents toward a
    particular answer.
7.  Ask about one thing at a time to prevent confusion and promote
    accurate responses. Avoid double-barreled questions that combine
    multiple topics.
8.  Steer clear of questions with single or double negations, as they
    can be confusing and lead to misinterpretation, even if some
    disciplines require a portion of questions to use negation.

## The Impact of Question Order

The order in which questions are presented in a survey can
profoundly influence the quality of responses and the level of engagement from respondents.
Effective sequencing of questions is crucial for gathering reliable data.
Here are some considerations:

1.  Start with easy and pleasant questions to build rapport and boost
    respondent confidence.
2.  Begin with questions directly addressing the main topic as described
    to the respondent prior to the survey.
3.  Group related questions together to maintain continuity and
    coherence.
4.  Sequence questions on a specific topic from general to specific,
    gradually narrowing the focus.
5.  Place sensitive questions that may make respondents uncomfortable
    towards the end of the questionnaire, allowing participants to warm
    up before addressing personal or sensitive topics.
6.  Include filter questions to avoid asking irrelevant queries. This
    ensures participants only answer questions applicable to them.

Adhering to these principles of question design and order can enhance
the quality and reliability of survey data.

## Survey Says: Bacon!

Edward Bernays, a prominent figure in public relations, was approached
by a bacon company seeking to boost sales.

Initially, Bernays conducted research and found that a substantial
breakfast was likely beneficial for health. Armed with this information,
he approached the physician on his team and requested his endorsement,
leading to a survey sent to 5,000 colleagues, all of whom agreed with
the health benefits of a hearty breakfast.

The results were sent to the media culminating in headlines proclaiming
"4,500 Physicians Advocate Heavy Breakfast for Improved Health." This
endorsement, along with the suggestion of incorporating bacon and eggs
into breakfast, had a significant impact on public perception.

It's worth noting that the bacon product itself was not in question.
Rather, Bernays utilized the opportunity to align the product with a
broader health message, successfully increasing bacon sales.

> What is wrong with the question and the conclusion?

What is better for health, a slight or substantial breakfast?

1.  Slight
2.  Substantial

"4,500 physicians urge heavy breakfast in order to improve the health of
the American people"

Have more Eggs and Bacon for breakfast!

## Types of Question Formats

Different types of question formats in a questionnaire enable capturing
diverse data types and facilitate varied response types from
participants. Three commonly used question formats are:

1.  **Radio Buttons:** Ideal for questions that require respondents to
    select only one answer from a list of options. The respondent
    chooses a single option by clicking on the corresponding radio
    button.

2.  **Checkboxes:** Suitable for questions that allow respondents to
    select multiple answers from a list of options. The respondent can
    select multiple checkboxes to indicate their choices.

3.  **Text Boxes:** Used when respondents need to provide a written
    response or input data not covered by predefined options. Text boxes
    allow users to type in their responses freely.

Properly utilizing these question formats ensures that your
questionnaire captures the necessary information and provides clear
response options. However, it's essential to provide clear instructions
on how participants should input their responses, else the data might be
susceptible to interpretation.

7](images/1_or_7.png)

The choice of question format should align with the nature of the
question and the type of response you are seeking.

## Likert Scales

Likert scales are commonly used in surveys to measure attitudes,
opinions, and perceptions. Here are some considerations when choosing
the number of scale points:

1.  **5 or 7 Points:** Both 5-point and 7-point scales are widely used
    and offer sufficient response options for capturing a range of
    opinions. There is generally no significant difference in response
    patterns between these two options.

2.  **Consider Respondent Ease:** Using a lower number of scale points,
    such as 5, makes it easier for respondents to quickly choose their
    answer. This leads to higher response rates and less respondent
    fatigue.

3.  **Higher Points for Specific Needs:** In some cases, a higher number
    of scale points may be necessary to capture nuanced responses or
    when greater precision is required. This could be relevant in
    specialized research or when examining highly specific attitudes or
    behaviors.

4.  **Follow Established Protocols:** If your survey is part of a larger
    study or research field, it is advisable to use the scale points
    commonly used in that context. This ensures consistency and
    comparability with existing research.

> At the end, the person who decides the scale is the one who pays ;)

Ultimately, the decision on the number of scale points rests with the
survey designer, considering specific research goals, target audience,
and practical considerations.

## "I don't know" and N/A Options

Including "I don't know" and N/A (not applicable) response options in
surveys can impact data quality.
@krosnickImpactNoOpinion2002 explored the impact of "no opinion"
response options and their effects on data quality, highlighting
potential trade-offs associated with their inclusion.
Some considerations are:

1.  **Potential Impact on Data Quality:** Inclusion of "I don't know"
    and N/A options may not necessarily improve data quality. It can
    sometimes limit the measurement of meaningful opinions by providing
    an 'easy way out' for respondents who might otherwise give a
    thoughtful response.

2.  **Influence of Mental Fatigue:** Respondents experiencing fatigue or
    uncertainty about their opinions may select neutral options like "I
    don't know," resulting in a higher proportion of neutral responses
    and potentially masking genuine attitudes.

3.  **Optional Questions:** All questions in a survey are optional.
    Respondents can choose to skip questions they do not want to answer
    or do not apply to them. Making questions optional allows
    individuals to provide answers only to the questions they feel
    comfortable or knowledgeable answering.

It's crucial to consider these factors when designing surveys and
deciding whether to include "I don't know" and N/A response options.

## Survey Length

The length of a survey can have significant implications for participant
engagement and data quality. Below are some key points to keep in mind:

1.  **Drop-out Rates:** In web-based university studies
    [@hoergerParticipantDropoutFunction2010], there is typically an
    instantaneous drop-out rate of around 10%, with an additional 2%
    drop for every 100 survey items. Consequently, longer surveys could
    lead to higher attrition rates as participants might become fatigued
    or lose interest.

2.  **Satisficing and Quality of Responses:** Lengthy surveys,
    particularly in lab-based research, can result in satisficing
    behavior [@vriesemaAssessingSurveySatisficing2021] where
    participants offer "good enough" responses instead of providing
    thoughtful and accurate answers. This could negatively impact data
    quality. However, these adverse effects may not significantly affect
    the overall results [@bansakBreakingPointSurvey2021].

3.  **Online Marketing Questionnaires:** For online marketing surveys,
    keeping the survey length short is advisable
    [@wigmoreWhatGoodSurvey2022]. Surveys longer than a few questions
    are likely to experience significant drop-out rates. Surveys taking
    longer than 10 minutes are strongly discouraged to maintain
    participant engagement.

Survey designers should strive to balance between acquiring the
necessary information and keeping the survey manageable for respondents
to ensure optimal participant engagement and data quality.

## Survey Invitation

When inviting participants to a survey, it's crucial to establish trust
and provide necessary information. Here are some key elements to
consider:

1.  **Introduction:** Clearly identifying yourself and explaining the
    reason for reaching out to the specific person can help build trust
    and credibility.

2.  **Purpose and Benefits:** Outlining the purpose of the survey and
    the benefits of participation can motivate the respondents. Explain
    how their responses will contribute to the research or
    decision-making process.

3.  **Incentives:** If applicable, mentioning any incentives or rewards
    offered for participating in the survey can help motivate
    individuals to complete the survey.

4.  **Survey Overview:** Providing an overview of the topics or
    questions covered in the survey helps manage expectations and assist
    participants in managing their time.

5.  **Closing Time:** Specifying the deadline or closing time for the
    survey completion can create a sense of urgency and ensure timely
    responses.

In addition to these, consider adding a "Thank You" page after
participants complete the survey. This shows appreciation for their time
and participation.

A clear and concise privacy statement addressing privacy concerns can
assure participants that their responses will remain confidential and
used solely for research purposes.

Lastly, outlining your follow-up plan can let participants know if and
how you will share the survey results or any actions that will be taken
based on the findings.

Incorporating these elements into your survey invitation can improve
participant engagement and enhance the overall survey experience.
