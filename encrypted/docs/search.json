Young data professionals typically learn about models, experiments, and theories during their classes and frequently return to that knowledge. However, executing high-quality research and analysis necessitates a deeper understanding of the tools and the “How” rather than just the “What” and “Why”. The knowledge required often transcends what is taught within the constraints of a standard curriculum. In this book, I aim to bridge that gap between knowing what you want to do and understanding how to do it. I’ve distilled hundreds of hours of frustrations into these chapters, so you won’t have to traverse that path yourself."

    "text": "1.1 About the book\nThis book’s genesis was a collection of notes and reading materials for a class I taught on Survey Design in Spring 2023. The positive reception and plethora of insightful questions from the students spurred me to systematize and weave these resources into this book.\nThis book is not a comprehensive guide; if that’s what you’re seeking, you may want to look elsewhere. Instead, this book serves as a map that outlines the necessary tools and topics for your research journey. We’ll delve into the basics of data collection, cleaning, validation, and presentation, all while underpinning these concepts with relevant theory. The goal is to build your intuition and provide pointers for where to find more detailed information. The chapters are deliberately concise and to the point, as my objective isn’t to bore you, but to enlighten."

    "text": "1.2 Who Should Read This Book\nWhile my experiences in Economics graduate school served as the primary motivation for writing this book, I’ve aimed to make it universally applicable for anyone working with data. That’s why you’ll find dedicated chapters on topics like thesis writing and literature reviews. If your work involves humanities, data analytics, or anything in-between, I’m confident that you’ll find this book valuable. Whether you’re a seasoned professional brushing up on some skills or a beginner hoping to learn something new, I promise you’ll discover something useful here.\nAlthough the examples in this book are written in R, which I believe to be one of the most powerful statistical languages, you don’t need prior knowledge of it to benefit from the content. The book focuses on the underlying concepts behind the tools, making it framework-agnostic. Some of the more theoretical chapters do not even require any programming knowledge. Over time, individuals and teams from diverse domains, such as web development, mathematics, data analytics, and economics, have found the content valuable for their work. So regardless of your coding skills or professional background, there’s something in here for you.\nThe book does not need to be read sequentially, but the chapters are ordered and build upon each other for those who prefer a more structured approach. Initially, the data manipulation part was positioned in the middle, but it was moved to the beginning to aid those who need to understand R code earlier."

    "text": "2.1 R and RStudio Set Up\nTo begin our data analysis journey, we will utilize the R language, which was specifically designed by statisticians for statisticians. R boasts an intuitive syntax and workflow, enabling us to create readable and reproducible code, making it ideal for data analysis tasks.\nBefore we dive into the exciting world of data exploration and modeling, it’s essential to understand the distinction between R and RStudio IDE. R is the actual programming language itself, while RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a user-friendly interface to work with R efficiently. In other words, RStudio serves as a helpful tool to interact with R and enhances the overall coding experience.\nTo get started, you’ll need to download both R and RStudio. R acts as the backbone, and RStudio complements it, making the coding process smoother and more accessible, especially for beginners. So, make sure to install both R and RStudio on your computer to embark on your data analysis journey seamlessly. Let’s dive in and explore the incredible possibilities that R and RStudio have to offer! ## Download R\nR is maintained through The Comprehensive R Archive Network.\n\n2.1.1 For macOS\n\nGo to https://cran.r-project.org/\nSelect “Download R for macOS”\nIf you have Apple Silicon mac (M1,M2…) download the latest version that has -arm64 in its name (R-4.2.2-arm64.pkg)\nIf you have Intel Max Download one without -arm64 (R-4.2.2.pkg)\nFollow the steps from the installation wizzard\nThe installer lets you customize your installation, but the defaults will be suitable for most users\nYour computer might ask for your password before installing new programs\n\n\n\n2.1.2 For Windows\n\nGo to https://cran.r-project.org/\nSelect “Download R for Windows”\nClick on “base”\nClick the first link at the top of the new page (Download R-4.2.2 for Windows)\nink downloads an installer program, which installs the most up-to-date version of R for Windows.\nFollow the steps from the installation wizzard\nThe installer lets you customize your installation, but the defaults will be suitable for most users\nYou might need administration privileges to install new software on your machine"

Change the default theme of RStudio from light to dark! To do this\n\nGo to the top panel\nSelect the Tools tab\nNavigate to Global Options\nSelect Appearance\nIn Editor Theme, select “Dracula”\nClick Apply\n\nNow let’s install a cooler font with ligatures! Install fira-code: https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing. Restart RStudio for the font to load. Then go back to Appearance, choose FiraCode, and hit apply."

These packages typically focus on a specific task and make use of pre-written routines for various data science tasks.\nYou can install packages with a single line of code:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nYou can also install multiple packages at the same time using c():\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\",\"gapminder\"))\nYou can load packages using the library() function:\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nRun the following command to install packages we will use in class\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"janitor\", \"esquisse\", \"modelsummary\", \"styler\"))"
