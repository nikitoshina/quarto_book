Now let's install a cooler font with ligatures! Install fira-code: [https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing). **Restart** RStudio for the font to load. Then go back to Appearance, choose FiraCode, and hit apply.

## Install Packages
An R package is a collection of useful functions, documentation, and data sets that can be used in your own R code after it is loaded. These packages typically focus on a specific task and make use of pre-written routines for various data science tasks.

You can install packages with a single line of code:

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
You can also install multiple packages at the same time using c():

```
install.packages(c("tidyverse","gapminder"))
```
You can load packages using the library() function:

```
library("tidyverse")
```

Run the following command to install packages we will use in class
```
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "janitor", "esquisse", "modelsummary", "styler"))

```
